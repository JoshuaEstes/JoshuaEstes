PHP engineer. Symfony ecosystem contributor. Engineering leader.

I’ve been building and maintaining PHP systems since before Composer became standard. 
Over the years I’ve worked on SaaS platforms, e-commerce systems, payment integrations, 
DevOps automation, CI/CD pipelines, and legacy modernization projects.

Still writing code. Still learning. Still shipping.

## What I Focus On

- Modernizing legacy PHP applications (5.x → 8.x migrations)
- Designing modular, contract-driven architectures
- Event-driven systems and domain modeling
- Multi-tenant SaaS platforms
- CI/CD and developer workflow improvement
- Payment and e-commerce integrations
- Long-term maintainability over short-term cleverness

## Public Work

### Sons of PHP
Reusable PHP components focused on modularity and clean contracts.
Framework-agnostic where possible. Built to be read and reused.

### Commerce Kitty
Multi-tenant marketplace automation platform used to experiment with:
- Plugin-based extensibility
- Marketplace integrations
- E-commerce domain modeling
- SaaS architecture patterns

## Engineering Philosophy

Code should be readable.
Architecture should be intentional.
Automation should reduce friction.
Technical debt should be addressed deliberately, not ignored.

If it isn’t maintainable in five years, it isn’t done.
