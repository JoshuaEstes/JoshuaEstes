# Joshua Estes

PHP engineer. Symfony ecosystem contributor. Engineering leader.

I’ve been building and maintaining PHP systems since before Composer became standard. 
Over the years I’ve worked on SaaS platforms, e-commerce systems, payment integrations, 
DevOps automation, CI/CD pipelines, and legacy modernization projects.

Still writing code. Still learning. Still shipping.

## What I Focus On

- Modernizing legacy PHP applications (5.x → 8.x migrations)
- Designing modular, contract-driven architectures
- Event-driven systems and domain modeling
- Multi-tenant SaaS platforms
- CI/CD and developer workflow improvement
- Payment and e-commerce integrations
- Long-term maintainability over short-term cleverness

## Public Work

Framework-agnostic where possible. Built to be read and reused.

Multi-tenant marketplace automation platform used to experiment with:
- Plugin-based extensibility
- Marketplace integrations
- E-commerce domain modeling

## Engineering Philosophy

Code should be readable.
Architecture should be intentional.
Automation should reduce friction.
Technical debt should be addressed deliberately, not ignored.

If it isn’t maintainable in five years, it isn’t done.
